This directory is meant to be used to return the assignments for the course,
Full Stack -websovelluskehitys.

The directory is used the following way:

1. Composition of the directory:
In the root directory there is sub-folders where one folder contains the assignments 
for the named part of the course. There is also a folder which contains practice codes 
which are not to be evaluated/included to the course assignments.

2. Naming of the files:
Assignment folders are named as follows
=> {part of the course}_teht (not including the practice folder 'harjoituksia')
The actual Assignment folders/projects are named as follows
=> {number of the part of the course}_{name of the project}_{numbers of the assignments that it contains}
(e.g. 2-kurssitiedot_1-5 => belongs to the Osa2 of the course => name of the assignment is kurssitiedot 
=> and it contains the assingments from 1 through 5 in that part of the course)
